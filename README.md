# Google-Book-Search

## Over View

I created a new React-based Google Books Search app. 
Google Book Search helps users to search books and save them for future reference using Google Books API and MongoDB.
Also use Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB so that users can save books.

`Search`  User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here.<br>
`Saved` Renders all books saved to the Mongo database.
